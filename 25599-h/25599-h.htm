	<p><span class="first_word">Judge</span> we of coming, by the by-past, years,</p>
	<p>And still can Hope, the siren, soothe our fears?</p>
	<p>Cheated, deceived, our cherished day-dreams o&#8217;er,</p>
	<p>We cling the closer, and we trust the more.</p>
	<p>Oh, who can say there&#8217;s bliss in the review</p>
	<p>Of hours, when Hope with fairy fingers drew</p>
	<p>A magic sketch of &#8220;rapture yet to be,&#8221;</p>
	<p>A rainbow horizon, a life of glee!</p>
	<p>The world all bright before us&#8212;vivid scene</p>
	<p>Of cloudless sunshine and of fadeless green;</p>
	<p>A treacherous picture of our coming years,</p>
	<p>Bright in prospective&#8212;welcomed but with tears.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>How false the view, a backward glance will tell!</p>
	<p>A tale of visions wrecked, of broken spell,</p>
	<p>Of valued hearts estranged or careless grown,</p>
	<p>Affection&#8217;s links dissevered or unknown;</p>
	<p>Of joys, deemed fadeless, gone to swift decay,</p>
	<p>And love&#8217;s broad circle dwindled half away;</p>
	<p>Of early graves of friends who, one by one,</p>
	<p>Leave us at last to journey on alone.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Turn to the home of childhood&#8212;hallowed spot,</p>
	<p>Through life&#8217;s vicissitudes still unforgot;</p>
	<p>The sacred hearth deserted now is found,</p>
	<p>Or unloved stranger-forms are circling round.</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>In the dear hall, whose sounds were all our own,</p>
	<p>Are other voices, other accents known;</p>
	<p>And where our early friends? A starting tear</p>
	<p>And the rude headstone promptly answer, &#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Thus will compare Hope&#8217;s sketch of bliss to be</p>
	<p>With the undreamed of, sad reality;</p>
	<p>Yet this and more the afflicted heart may bear,</p>
	<p>If Faith, celestial visitant, be there,</p>
	<p>Whispering of greener shores, of purer skies,</p>
	<p>Of flowers unfading, love that never dies,</p>
	<p>A glimpse of joy to come in mercy given,</p>
	<p>The eternal sunshine of approving Heaven.</p>

	<p>Feels in this darksome hour there&#8217;s much to do&#8212;</p>
	<p>Earth fading fast, Heaven&#8217;s portals far from view.</p>

	<h2>WRITTEN AFTER A VISIT TO THE INSTITUTION

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p><span class="first_word">I thought</span> those youthful hearts were bleak and bare,</p>
	<p>That not a germ had ever flourished there,</p>
	<p>Unless perchance the night-shade of despair,</p>
	<p class="i2">Which blooms amid the sunless wilderness.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>But I was told that flowers of fairest kind</p>
	<p>Graced what I deemed a desert of the mind,</p>
	<p>That for these hapless beings man had twined</p>
	<p class="i2">A fadeless wreath to make their sorrows less.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>And then I feared, like sunbeams of the morn</p>
	<p>Which spoil the frost-work they awhile adorn,</p>
	<p>That rays of light might render more forlorn</p>
	<p class="i2">The expanding bosoms they were meant to cheer.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">

	<p><span class="first_word">Oh!</span> Time, as it fleets, dooms a joy to decay,</p>
	<p>From the chaplet of hope steals a blossom away,</p>

	<p>It sullies a link in affection&#8217;s young chain,</p>
	<p>That, once slightly tarnished, ne&#8217;er sparkles again,</p>

	<p>And pours on the gale a celestial perfume;</p>
	<p>Where ethereal melodies steal through the soul,</p>

	<h2>LIFE&#8217;S STAGES.</h2>

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p><span class="first_word">To</span> the heart of trusting childhood life is all a gilded way,</p>
	<p>Wherein a beam of sunny bliss forever seems to play;</p>
	<p>It roams about delightedly through pleasure&#8217;s roseate bower,</p>
	<p>And gaily makes a playmate, too, of every bird and flower;</p>
	<p>Holds with the rushing of the winds companionship awhile,</p>
	<p>And, on the tempest&#8217;s darkest brow, discerns a brightening smile,</p>
	<p>Converses with the babbling waves, as on their way they wend,</p>
	<p>And sees, in everything it meets, the features of a friend.</p>
	<p>&#8220;To-day&#8221; is full of rosy joy, &#8220;to-morrow&#8221; is not here:</p>
	<p>When, for an uncreated hour, was childhood known to fear?</p>
	<p>Not until hopes, warm hopes, its heart a treasure-house have made,</p>
	<p>Like summer flowers to bloom awhile, like them, alas, to fade;</p>
	<p>Cherished too fondly and too long, for ah! the rich parterre,</p>
	<p>Crushed in its brightest blossoming, leaves but a desert there.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>This is life&#8217;s second stage; the gloss of springtime has passed o&#8217;er,</p>
	<p>The trusting bosom is deceived, but still it trusts the more;</p>
	<p>Its young affections are bound up within a mother&#8217;s love,</p>
	<p>And oh! if blessings ever yet descended from above</p>
	<p>And rested on an earthly tie to mark approval given,</p>
	<p>A mother&#8217;s love, assuredly, is sanctioned thus by Heaven.</p>
	<p>But soon the ruthless spoiler comes, and all its trust is vain:</p>
	<p>The eye that beamed so kindly once, will ne&#8217;er unclose again;</p>
	<p>The voice of love that still could soothe when all its hopes were o&#8217;er,</p>
	<p>Alas! those sweetly sacred tones are hushed forever-more;</p>
	<p>The smile that lingered round its path when other lights had fled,</p>
	<p>Oh! can it be that blessed smile is buried with the dead?</p>
	<p>Then what is left the orphan heart thus mournfully bereft?</p>
	<p>To call its crushed affections home and count the treasures left,</p>
	<p>With trembling fear to count them o&#8217;er, and bitterly to sigh,</p>
	<p>Remembering they are earthly too,&#8212;they, too, alas, must die.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>Perchance of its remaining joys, its fondly garnered things,</p>
	<p>One may be dearer than the rest&#8212;to that it fondly clings;</p>
	<p>And, resting thus confidingly, it half forgets the woe</p>
	<p>Which changed the orphan&#8217;s joyous tones to cadence sad and low.</p>
	<p>And can the stern destroyer find naught else to call his own</p>
	<p>That he has stamped his fearful mark upon this chosen one?</p>
	<p>It boots not to inquire the cause, the why it must be so;</p>
	<p>&#8220;It is his victim,&#8221; this alone is pain enough to know.</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s left thee now, poor orphan heart, that entered life so gay,</p>
	<p>And fondly dreamed &#8217;twould all have proved a bright and cloudless way?</p>
	<p>Where are the joys that wreathed thee round in childhood&#8217;s reckless hours?</p>
	<p>&#8217;Twas thine to watch them droop and fall, like pale, decaying flowers.</p>
	<p>Where is thy home of love? Ah! well, that thought may cloud thy brow&#8212;</p>
	<p>The dear loved home that sheltered thee is claimed by strangers now;</p>
	<p>And does that echoing hall repeat no well-remembered tone?</p>
	<p>The stranger&#8217;s voice, the stranger&#8217;s step have there familiar grown.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>And where the joyous faces now that circled round the hearth?</p>
	<p>Gone. Are all gone? Then changed indeed, fearfully changed, is earth!</p>
	<p>Alas! poor desolated heart, what more remains for thee?</p>
	<p>(A sad and solitary wreck on life&#8217;s tempestuous sea)&#8212;</p>
	<p>What but to feel, destroying Time, indeed, has roughly past</p>
	<p>And blighted fairest dreams of bliss, oh! too, too fair to last;</p>
	<p>What but to muse on perished joys to which sad memory clings,</p>
	<p>While pleasure&#8217;s wrecked and ruined hopes, a mournful band, she brings,</p>
	<p>Death&#8217;s trophies, which proclaim his shaft at treasured bliss he threw,</p>
	<p>And oh! which mournfully disclose his fearful victory too.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Yes, this is life! but life it is without that heavenly ray</p>
	<p>Which ever throws its purest light upon the stormiest way;</p>
	<p>Which sweetly gilds the darkest sky and comes like angel voice,</p>
	<p>(E&#8217;en &#8217;mid the wreck of dearest hopes), to bid the heart rejoice;</p>
	<p>Which flings a smile on sorrow&#8217;s brow, and sunshine on the tomb,</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>And scatters o&#8217;er the bed of death bright buds of deathless bloom.</p>
	<p>&#8217;Tis true the parting hour will come, &#8220;the loved&#8221; it cannot save;</p>
	<p>But it can teach us with a smile to yield them to the grave;</p>
	<p>To watch with chastened sober bliss the spirit&#8217;s calm release,</p>
	<p>Trusting, though life have storms for us, all with the dead is peace.</p>
	<p>And even while the bosom aches, aches to its inmost core,</p>
	<p>This heavenly beam can bid it joy that earthly ties are o&#8217;er.</p>
	<p>For oh! our covenant Lord, who ne&#8217;er his sacred promise breaks,</p>
	<p>Has sweetly said, when all the world, the changing world, forsakes,</p>
	<p>He will be all the world to us; then freely may the heart</p>
	<p>Resign the fondly coffered bliss that clogs the immortal part,</p>
	<p>(In holy trust &#8217;twill all be ours when earth has passed away,)</p>
	<p>And calmly wait the unclouded dawn of an eternal day,</p>
	<p>Conscious while God is near, earth&#8217;s best and purest joy is given,</p>
	<p>For &#8217;tis His holy presence makes the perfect bliss of Heaven.</p>

	<p>But has the fearful sacrifice at last been made in vain?</p>
	<p>And shall no trace within our hearts, no deathless trace remain?</p>
	<p>Bright record, that with us awhile their dwelling place has been,</p>
	<p>Preparing temples for their Lord&#8217;s high service to begin.</p>
	<p>Oh yes, I trust, a fount of light and life they have unsealed</p>
	<p>To many a thirsting, fainting soul, a Saviour&#8217;s love revealed;</p>
	<p>Have taught &#8220;that in his service there is perfect freedom&#8221; still,</p>
	<p>That &#8217;tis the highest bliss of Heaven to do his sovereign will,</p>
	<p>And if a humble suppliant may bow before Thy throne,</p>
	<p>My Father! and a blessing ask on hearts to her unknown,</p>
	<p>Oh! grant for them &#8220;the lines may fall in pleasant places&#8221; here,</p>
	<p>&#8220;Beside still waters&#8221; bid them rest, and feel that Thou art near.</p>
	<p>Thou hast Thyself declared, that great their recompense shall be,</p>
	<p>Who have &#8220;forsaken all&#8221; to love and follow only Thee;</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>And they have left the &#8220;near and dear,&#8221; the parent, child, and friend;</p>
	<p>Then in Thy holy name may all these sweet affections blend!</p>
	<p>And should the world desert them, Lord, oh, be the world to them,</p>
	<p>The song of their rejoicing here, in Heaven the crowning gem;</p>
	<p>Thy sacred guidance grant, I pray, o&#8217;er life&#8217;s tempestuous sea,</p>
	<p>Awhile a gentle course, and then,&#8212;a sheltering port in Thee.</p>

	<p class="i2">A darkness to be felt,</p>
	<p>Light sweetly shone round Goshen still,</p>

	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Awestruck, the Egyptians silent lay,</p>
	<p class="i2">They rose not from their place;</p>
	<p>God&#8217;s finger had been o&#8217;er their land,</p>
	<p class="i2">And left a fearful trace.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>The very idols which they served</p>
	<p class="i2">A gloom around them threw,</p>

	<p class="i2">The sun his light withdrew.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened still,</p>
	<p class="i2">He let not Israel go</p>

	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>No house remained in this proud land</p>
	<p class="i2">Which mourned not for its dead,</p>
	<p>And every street was filled with gloom,</p>
	<p class="i2">And every heart with dread.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>At midnight was the message sent&#8212;</p>
	<p class="i2">It was an awful hour,</p>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>The mighty monarch, struck with awe,</p>

	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>And how were Israel employed</p>
	<p class="i2">When light around them shone?</p>
	<p>They then prepared the paschal lamb,</p>
	<p class="i2">And stood with sandals on;</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Staves in their hands, loins girded too,</p>
	<p class="i2">They waited the command</p>
	<p>To throw their loosened shackles off,</p>
	<p class="i2">And seek the promised land.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66">&nbsp;</a>But first they ate the passover,</p>
	<p class="i2">And freely sprinkled round</p>
	<p>The blood of an unblemished lamb,</p>
	<p class="i2">In whom no spot was found.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>And the destroying angel passed</p>
	<p class="i2">Harmless o&#8217;er every door</p>
	<p>Whose side-posts and whose lintels, too,</p>
	<p class="i2">Faith&#8217;s striking symbol bore.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Now let us pause and ask our hearts</p>
	<p class="i2">If we have aught to learn,</p>
	<p>If very many teaching things</p>

	<p>And oh! when God&#8217;s own Israel</p>

	<p class="i2">And supplicate in vain?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Ah, no! upon the captive still</p>
	<p class="i2">Is poured a flood of light,</p>
	<p>While he prepares for better worlds</p>

	<p>Not settled down in carnal ease,</p>

	<p>Christ is his holy passover,</p>
	<p class="i2">He has a part in Him;</p>
	<p>For he applies his blood, in faith,</p>

	<p>But oh! with very bitter herbs</p>

	<p>Haste away o&#8217;er the waves, then, glad tidings to spread;</p>
	<p>Thy Master has called thee, no longer delay,</p>
	<p>His work it is glorious, haste, haste thee away.</p>
	<p>Come, set the sails, mariner, now we&#8217;re off shore,</p>
	<p>Then weep for the loved ones thou leavest no more;</p>
	<p>He is faithful who promised, thou heard&#8217;st Him declare</p>
	<p>That all thou intrusts to his fatherly care</p>
	<p>He will keep in the sheltering fold of his love,</p>
	<p>Where nothing shall harm them and nothing shall move.</p>
	<p>He will suffer no plague nigh thy dwelling to come,</p>
	<p>And His angels shall guard thee wherever thou roam;</p>
	<p>No weapon shall prosper that&#8217;s formed against thee,</p>
	<p>For the truth thou hast loved, shield and buckler shall be.</p>
	<p>This the heritage is of the child of the Lord,</p>
	<p>Of him who confides in his covenant word,</p>
	<p>And freely forsakes, when his Saviour commands,</p>
	<p>His brethren, and sisters, and children, and lands.</p>
	<p>Though the ocean may roar, and earth shake with the swell,</p>
	<p>His home is in Jesus, and all will be well;</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70">&nbsp;</a>Though the mountains depart, and the hills may remove,</p>
	<p>He quietly rests &#8217;neath the wing of His love.</p>
	<p>He knows that the work of the righteous is peace,</p>
	<p>That the blessed effect thereof never shall cease;</p>
	<p>A gracious assurance of quietude here,</p>
	<p>And bliss without end in a holier sphere.</p>
	<p>So, Christian, God speed thee, and should the storm lower,</p>
	<p>Cast firmly thine anchor, and trust in His power.</p>
	<p>His voice than the billows is mightier far,</p>
	<p>And His mercy is o&#8217;er thee a safe guiding star.</p>
	<p>But oh! when the clouds have all vanished away,</p>
	<p>And life smiles around thee, a bright summer&#8217;s day,</p>
	<p>When the breeze wafts thee onward, and no rocks appear,</p>
	<p>Then, Christian, thine hour of peril is near;</p>
	<p>The world may frown on thee, but oh! should it smile,</p>
	<p>Come apart to the desert, and rest thee awhile.</p>
